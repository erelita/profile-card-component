## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Made a lot of <div>s to make the layout work. Having containers/wrappers made it easier to use Flex CSS to customized each sections.

I had a little problem with the responsiveness of the two circles in the background. I tried adding @media queries for different min-width (768px, 1024px, 1440px), but there's always a breaking point while changing the screensize.


### Continued development

I'm still having problems with responsive layouts, so I think I'll focus more on that in the following projects/challenges.
